  # Project Name
British Spoken Time

## Problem Statement
In British English, the expression "half [hour]" is used colloquially to denote 30 minutes past the hour. For example, " half ten" means 10:30 
(without specifying morning or night). This is itself an abbreviation of an older colloquialism, "half 'past' ten". The abbreviation can cause misunderstanding with 
non-British English speakers as this contrasts with many European languages, where the same type of expression denotes 30 minutes before the hour. 
For example, in Czech, půl desáté ("half ten") means 9:30. Another example, in German, halb zehn ("half ten") means 9:30. 

## Solution

The solution takes input in HH:MM format and output is in words.
For example, if input is 4:15, output will be qaurter past four.
